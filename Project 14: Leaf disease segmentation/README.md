## PROJECT 14: Leaf disease segmentation


> ### TASK: Semantic Segmentation

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

Studying architecture: **DeepLab**


#### Project objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Training DeepLab


### Dataset

[Leaf disease segmentation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fakhrealam9537/leaf-disease-segmentation-dataset)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

This dataset contains 588 images of disease leaf and 588 masks of the corresponding images.
The data collection is based on the PlantDoc images.
You can use this dataset to plant leaf disease segmentation from images.
