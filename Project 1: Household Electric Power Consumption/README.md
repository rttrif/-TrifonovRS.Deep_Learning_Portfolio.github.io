## PROJECT 1: Household Electric Power Consumption

> ### TASK: Regression

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

Development of skills for building and improving neural network models for **regression** using the sequential and functional Tensorflow API

#### Project objectives

1. Data preparation
2. Training a basic [simple model] using the sequential Tensorflow API and improving it.
3. Training the basic [complex model] using the Tensorflow functional API and improving it using various methods.
4. Training an [ensemble] of several models

### Dataset

**Attribute Information:**

1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss

3.globalactivepower: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

4.globalreactivepower: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 

5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

7.submetering1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

8.submetering2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

9.submetering3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
