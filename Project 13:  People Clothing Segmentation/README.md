## PROJECT 13: People Clothing Segmentation

> ### TASK: Semantic Segmentation

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

Studying architecture: **U-Net**


#### Project objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Training U-Net


### Dataset

[People Clothing Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/rajkumarl/people-clothing-segmentation)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

The dataset contains 1000 images and 1000 corresponding semantic segmentation masks each of size 825 pixels by 550 pixels in PNG format. The segmentation masks belong to 59 classes, the first being the background of individuals, and the rest belong to 58 clothing classes such as shirt, hair, pants, skin, shoes, glasses and so on. A CSV file containing the list of 59 classes is included in the dataset. The dataset contains data in both JPEG formats and PNG formats. However, JPEG is found to be lossy, while PNG is lossless with the essence of Originality.
