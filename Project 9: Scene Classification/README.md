## PROJECT 9: Scene Classification

> ### TASK: Multi-class classification

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

Studying architecture: **Inception**
1. Inception - version 1
2. Inception - version 2
3. Inception - version 3

#### Project objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Training Inception V1
3. Training Inception V2
4. Training Inception V3
5. Training Inception V4

### Dataset

[Scene Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/nitishabharathi/scene-classification)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

This dataset contains about ~25k images from a wide range of natural scenes from all around the world. The task is to identify which kind of scene can the image be categorized into.

It is a 6 class problem
- Buildings
- Forests
- Mountains
- Glacier
- Street
- Sea

### Results
