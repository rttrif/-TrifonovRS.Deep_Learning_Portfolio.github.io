## PROJECT 19: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

> ### TASK: Natural Language Processing

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

- Studying **Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.**
- Studying **TF-IDF** (term frequency-inverse document frequency)


#### Project objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Training ultinomial Naive Bayes
3. Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not


### Dataset

[Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

##### Files
- train.csv - the training set
- test.csv - the test set
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

##### Columns
- id - a unique identifier for each tweet
- text - the text of the tweet
- location - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)
- keyword - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)
- target - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)

### Results

1. [ ] [**Multinomial Naive Bayes**]()
