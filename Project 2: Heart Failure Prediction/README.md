## PROJECT 2: Heart Failure Prediction

> ### TASK: Binary classification 

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

Development of skills for building and improving neural network models for **binary classification** using the sequential and functional Tensorflow API

#### Project objectives

1. Data preparation
2. Training a basic simple model using the sequential Tensorflow API and improving it.
3. Training the basic complex model using the Tensorflow functional API and improving it using various methods.
4. Training an ensemble of several models

### Dataset

[Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) 

**Attribute Information:**

1. age: Age of the patient 
2. anaemia: If the patient had the haemoglobin below the normal range 
3. creatinine_phosphokinase: The level of the creatine phosphokinase in the blood in mcg/L 
4. diabetes: If the patient was diabetic 
5. ejection_fraction: Ejection fraction is a measurement of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction 
6. high_blood_pressure: If the patient had hypertension 
7. platelets: Platelet count of blood in kiloplatelets/mL 
8. serum_creatinine: The level of serum creatinine in the blood in mg/dL 
9. serum_sodium: The level of serum sodium in the blood in mEq/L 
10. sex: The sex of the patient 
11. smoking: If the patient smokes actively or ever did in past 
12. time: It is the time of the patient's follow-up visit for the disease in months 
13. DEATH_EVENT: If the patient deceased during the follow-up period
