## PROJECT 7: Vehicle Classification


> ### TASK: Multi-class classification

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

Studying architecture: **VGG**
1. VGG-16
2. VGG-19

#### Project objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Training VGG-16
3. Training VGG-19

### Dataset

[Animal Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/animal-faces/code)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

This dataset, also known as Animal Faces-HQ (AFHQ), consists of 16,130 high-quality images at 512Ã—512 resolution.
There are three domains of classes, each providing about 5000 images. By having multiple (three) domains and diverse images of various breeds per each domain, AFHQ sets a challenging image-to-image translation problem. The classes are:

- Cat
- Dog 
- Wildlife

### Results

1. The basic model from the original article was created and trained - **AlexNet**
2. The basic model is improved by applying two regularization strategies: BatchNormalization + Dropout - **AlexNet_IMP**
