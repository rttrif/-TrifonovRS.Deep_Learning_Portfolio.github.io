## PROJECT 22: What's Cooking?

> ### TASK: Use recipe ingredients to categorize the cuisine with Natural Language Processing 

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

- Studying **Convolutional Neural Networks for NPL**

#### Project objectives

1. Explore and prepare data 
2. Training several 1D CNN


### Dataset

[What's Cooking?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking-kernels-only/data)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**


##### Context
In the dataset, we include the recipe id, the type of cuisine, and the list of ingredients of each recipe (of variable length). The data is stored in JSON format. 



##### Content
- `train.json` - the training set containing recipes id, type of cuisine, and list of ingredients
- `test.json` - the test set containing recipes id, and list of ingredients
- `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format

### Results

1. [x] [**CNN models for text**]()
