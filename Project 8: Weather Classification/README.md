1. ResNet
2. ResNet-50

#### Project objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Training ResNet
3. Training ResNet-50

### Dataset

[Multi-class Weather Dataset](hhttps://www.kaggle.com/pratik2901/multiclass-weather-dataset/code)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

Multi-class weather dataset(MWD) for image classification is a valuable dataset used in the research paper entitled “Multi-class weather recognition from the still image using heterogeneous ensemble method”.

The dataset provides a platform for outdoor weather analysis by extracting various features for recognizing different weather conditions.


**Class:**
- Sunrise
- Shine
- Rain
- Cloudy

### Results

1. The basic model from the original article was created and trained - **ResNet**
2. The basic model from the original article was created and trained - **ResNet-50**
