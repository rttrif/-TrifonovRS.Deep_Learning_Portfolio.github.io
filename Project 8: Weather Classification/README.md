### Dataset

[Multi-class Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pratik2901/multiclass-weather-dataset)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

Multi-class weather dataset(MWD) for image classification is a valuable dataset used in the research paper entitled “Multi-class weather recognition from the still image using heterogeneous ensemble method”.

The dataset provides a platform for outdoor weather analysis by extracting various features for recognizing different weather conditions.


**Class:**
- Sunrise
- Shine
- Rain
- Cloudy
