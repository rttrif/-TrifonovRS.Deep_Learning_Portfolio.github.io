[FIRE Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/phylake1337/fire-dataset)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

Data was collected to train a model to distinguish between the images that contain fire (fire images) and regular images (non-fire images), so the whole problem was binary classification.

Data is divided into 2 folders, fireimages folder contains 755 outdoor-fire images some of them contains heavy smoke, the other one is non-fireimages which contain 244 nature images (eg: forest, tree, grass, river, people, foggy forest, lake, animal, road, and waterfall).

Hint: Data is skewed, which means the 2 classes(folders) doesn't have an equal number of samples, so make sure that you have a validation set with an equally-sized number of images per class (eg: 40 images of both fire and non-fire classes).
