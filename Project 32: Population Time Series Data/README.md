## PROJECT 32: Population Time Series Data

> ### TASK: Stady dense neural network for forecasting time series


### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

- Studying **Dense neural network for forecasting time series**

#### Project objectives

1. Explore and prepare data 
2. Building dense model

### Dataset

[Population Time Series Data](https://www.kaggle.com/census/population-time-series-data)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

This is a dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau hosted by the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED). FRED has a data platform found here and they update their information according the amount of data that is brought in. Explore the U.S. Census Bureau using Kaggle and all of the data sources available through the U.S. Census Bureau organization page!
