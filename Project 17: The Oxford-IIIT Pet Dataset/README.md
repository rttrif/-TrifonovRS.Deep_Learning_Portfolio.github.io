## PROJECT 17: The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset


> ### TASKS: Semantic Segmentation

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

- Studying **feature extraction** transfer learning 
- Studying Tensorflow Datasets 

#### Project objectives

1. Using TensorFlow Datasets to download and explore data
2. Building a feature extraction model
3. Viewing training results on TensorBoard

### Dataset

[The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

We have created a 37 category pet dataset with roughly 200 images for each class. The images have a large variations in scale, pose and lighting. All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation.


### Results

1. [x] [**Feature extraction model: DeepLab**]()
2. [x] [**TensorBoard for feature extraction model**]()
3. [x] [**Fine-tuning model: U-net**]()
4. [x] [**TensorBoard for fine-tuning model**]()
