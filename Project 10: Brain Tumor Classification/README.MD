## PROJECT 10: Brain Tumor Classification

> ### TASK: Multi-class classification

### Project goals and objectives

#### Project goal

Studying architecture: **Xception**


#### Project objectives

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Training Xception


### Dataset

[Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)

**DATASET INFORMATION:**

The folder contains MRI data. The images are already split into Training and Testing folders.
Each folder has more four subfolders. These folders have MRIs of respective tumor classes.
